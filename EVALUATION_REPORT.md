# Skywalkder Firehose Factory - Evaluation Report

## Overview
The repository contains a well-structured evaluation system for testing AI agents built with the OpenAI Agents SDK. The evaluation framework is designed to verify agent behavior and responses.

## Evaluation System Structure

### Main Components
- **Evaluation Runner**: `scripts/run-evals.ts` - Orchestrates running all evaluation files
- **Evaluation Scripts**: Located in `scripts/evals/` directory
- **Utility Functions**: `scripts/utils/llmj.ts` - LLM judge for response validation
- **npm Script**: `npm run evals` - Main command to run all evaluations

### Current Evaluations

#### 1. Order Handling Test (`get-orders.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Tests that the agent can respond to order queries
- **Test Input**: "show my orders"
- **Expected Behavior**: Agent should use the get_orders tool and return order information
- **Validation**: Checks for non-empty output from the agent

#### 2. Greeting Response Test (`respond-hi.ts`) 
- **Purpose**: Tests basic conversational ability
- **Test Input**: "hi"
- **Expected Behavior**: Agent should respond with an appropriate greeting
- **Validation**: Uses LLM judge (`llmj`) to verify the response contains a proper greeting

### Agent Architecture
The system uses a multi-agent architecture:
- **Main Assistant Agent**: Routes requests to specialized agents
- **Orders Agent**: Handles order-related queries with `get_orders` tool
- **Billing Agent**: Handles billing and invoice questions
- **Model**: All agents use GPT-4o

## Current Status

### ✅ Successful Setup
- Dependencies are installed correctly
- TypeScript compilation works
- Evaluation framework is properly structured
- Agent definitions are complete

### ❌ Blocked by Missing Configuration
**Issue**: Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

**Error Details**:
```
OpenAIError: The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty
```

Both evaluations fail immediately due to this configuration issue.

## Requirements to Run Evaluations

### 1. OpenAI API Key Setup
To run evaluations, you need:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or create a `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 2. Running Commands
Once the API key is configured:
```bash
# Run all evaluations
npm run evals

# Run individual evaluations  
npx tsx scripts/evals/get-orders.ts
npx tsx scripts/evals/respond-hi.ts

# Enable tracing for debugging
AGENTS_TRACE=1 npm run evals
```

## CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs evaluations on PRs and main branch pushes
- Uses `secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY` from repository secrets
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/evals.yml`

## Evaluation Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests both functional (orders) and conversational (greetings) capabilities
2. **LLM Judge Integration**: Uses secondary LLM to validate response quality
3. **Tool Integration**: Verifies that agents can properly use tools
4. **CI Integration**: Automated testing on code changes
5. **Clear Structure**: Well-organized and maintainable evaluation code

### Recommendations for Enhancement
1. **Add More Test Cases**: 
   - Billing agent functionality
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Multi-turn conversations
   - Edge cases for order queries

2. **Improve Validation**:
   - More specific assertions for order response format
   - Test actual tool invocation, not just final output
   - Validate handoff behavior between agents

3. **Add Performance Metrics**:
   - Response time measurements  
   - Token usage tracking
   - Success rate over multiple runs

## Next Steps
1. Configure OpenAI API key in environment
2. Run evaluations to establish baseline performance
3. Consider adding additional test scenarios
4. Monitor evaluation results in CI pipeline

## Architecture Summary
The evaluation system demonstrates good engineering practices with:
- Modular design separating concerns
- Automated testing infrastructure  
- LLM-based validation for subjective responses
- Clear documentation and usage patterns

The agents being tested implement a realistic customer service scenario with proper tool usage and agent handoffs.

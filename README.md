# AI App Scaffold

This project provides a minimal Next.js setup using the Vercel AI SDK and shadcn components. Chat requests sent to `/api/chat` are handled using the Agents SDK.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The main UI can be found on the index page and uses shadcn UI components for a simple chat interface.
